This is my package repo for [s6-linux-init](http://www.skarnet.org/software/s6-linux-init/), an init system builder by [Laurent Bercot](http://skarnet.org/).

The `upstream/` directory is taken directly from upstream. The rest of the repository is my packaging scripts for compiling a distributable build.

## Usage

To build a new package, update the submodule and run `make`. This launches the docker build container and builds the package.

To start a shell in the build environment for manual actions, run `make manual`.

## License

The s6-linux-init upstream code is ISC licensed. My packaging code is MIT licensed.
